- Your current credit account balances and your credit utilization ratio
- The number of recent credit inquiries
- Your payment history
- The amount of debt you owe

Credit scores are a numerical representation of a consumer’s creditworthiness. They are created using a complex algorithm that takes into account a variety of factors including payment history, amount of debt, and length of credit history. 

The most important factor in determining a credit score is payment history. A consumer with a history of on-time payments will have a higher credit score than a consumer with a history of late payments. The second most important factor is the amount of debt a consumer owes. Consumers with a lot of debt will have a lower credit score than consumers with a small amount of debt. 

The length of a credit history is also important. A consumer with a long credit history will have a higher credit score than a consumer with a short credit history. Finally, the type of credit a consumer has is also taken into account. Consumers with a mix of different types of credit will have a higher credit score than consumers with only one type of credit.
