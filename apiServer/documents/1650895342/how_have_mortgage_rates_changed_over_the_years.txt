- 1. The Mortgage Market in the United States: 


The mortgage market in the United States is one of the most important and heavily regulated markets in the world. The market is composed of lenders that make loans to home buyers, and investors that purchase mortgage-backed securities. The market is heavily regulated by the government, and has been through a number of booms and busts in its history.

The market originated in the 1920s, when banks began to offer mortgages to home buyers. The market grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, as the number of homeowners in the United States increased.

The mortgage market is regulated by a number of government agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
