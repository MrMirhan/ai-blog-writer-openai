The State of the Union Address is an annual speech given by the President of the United States to a joint session of the United States Congress. The address is typically delivered in late January or early February. The speech is a report on the condition of the nation, and the president's legislative agenda for the coming year. 

The Constitution of the United States requires that the president "from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."

The future of America is a topic of much debate. Some people believe that the country is on the decline, while others believe that it still has a bright future. In this blog post, I will argue that America does have a bright future, but that it will require some major changes.
