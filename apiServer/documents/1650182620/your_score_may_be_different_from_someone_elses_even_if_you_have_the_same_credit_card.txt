A credit score is a three-digit number that is calculated using a person's credit history. The score is designed to help lenders predict how likely it is that a borrower will repay a loan on time. The score is based on five factors: payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, new credit, and type of credit. 

The most important factor in a credit score is payment history. A person's credit score will be lower if they have missed payments or have been delinquent on their loans. Credit utilization is also important. Lenders want to know that borrowers are not using too much of their available credit. The length of credit history is also taken into account. A person with a longer credit history is seen as being less risky than someone who has only had a credit card for a few months. New credit and type of credit are also considered, but they are not as important as the first four factors. 

Credit scores range from 300 to 850.


Your credit score is calculated using a variety of factors including your payment history, the amount of debt you have, the length of your credit history, and your credit utilization rate.

Your payment history is the most important factor in determining your credit score. Late payments, missed payments, and defaults can all lower your score.

The amount of debt you have is also important. The more debt you have, the higher your credit utilization rate will be, and this can lower your credit score.

The length of your credit history is also important. The longer you have been using credit, the more reliable you are considered to be.

Your credit utilization rate is the percentage of your available credit that you are using. The lower your credit utilization rate, the better.
