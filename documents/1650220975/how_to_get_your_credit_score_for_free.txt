How to get your credit score for free

1. What is a credit score? 


Your credit score is a three digit number that is used to measure your credit risk. It is based on your credit history and is used by lenders to determine whether or not to lend you money and at what interest rate. The higher your credit score, the less risk you are to lenders and the more likely you are to be approved for a loan and to receive a lower interest rate.
2. How is a credit score calculated? 


Your credit score is a three-digit number that lenders use to help them decide how risky it is to lend you money. The score is based on a variety of factors, including how often you pay your bills on time, how much debt you have, and how long you’ve had your credit history.

The most important factor in your credit score is how often you pay your bills on time. Late payments can lower your score, while on-time payments can raise it.

Your credit score can also be affected by the amount of debt you have. The more debt you have, the higher the risk that you won’t be able to pay it back. This is especially true if you have high-interest debt, like credit cards.

The length of your credit history is also important. The longer you’ve had a credit history, the more likely it is that you’ll be able to pay back your debts.


3. What are the different types of credit scores? 


There are three credit score models that are used most often: FICO, VantageScore, and Experian National Equivalency Score.

FICO scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation and are used by most lenders. There are many different FICO scores, as each lender can have a different formula for how they use the data in your credit report to calculate your score.

VantageScore scores are developed by the three credit reporting agencies (CRAs): Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. VantageScore is used by some lenders, and is often used when you have a limited credit history.

The Experian National Equivalency Score is a proprietary score developed by Experian. This score is used by some lenders, and is designed to provide a score for people who don’t have credit histories.
