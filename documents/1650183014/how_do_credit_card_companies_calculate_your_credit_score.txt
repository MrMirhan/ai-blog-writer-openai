How do credit card companies calculate your credit score?


A credit score is a three-digit number that is based on your credit history. It is used to measure your creditworthiness and helps lenders determine the interest rate you will be charged for a loan. Your credit score is also used to determine whether you will be approved for a credit card or a mortgage. 

The most widely used credit score is the FICO score. The FICO score ranges from 300 to 850, and is based on five factors: payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, new credit and type of credit used. 

You can improve your credit score by paying your bills on time, maintaining a low credit utilization ratio, and using a variety of credit products. You can also get a copy of your credit score for free from AnnualCreditReport.com.

The higher your credit score, the more likely you are to be approved for a loan and to receive a lower interest rate.

Your credit score is calculated by a credit bureau, such as Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion. The credit bureau will look at your credit history and assign you a score between 300 and 850. The higher your score, the better your credit history.
