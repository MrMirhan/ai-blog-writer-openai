How to avoid student loan default 


- 1. What is student loan default? 


Defaulting on a student loan occurs when a borrower fails to make a payment for a period of 270 days. At this point, the loan is considered in default, and the borrower is responsible for all collection costs. 

Defaulting on a student loan can have serious consequences, including: 

- Damage to your credit score
- A wage garnishment order, which could reduce your income by up to 15%
- The loss of your tax refund
- The seizure of your assets
- The denial of future federal student loans and other government benefits, such as social security payments

- 2. The consequences of student loan default 


Defaulting on your student loans can have some pretty serious consequences.

First of all, your loans will go into default. This means that you’re no longer making payments on your loans, and your lender can take legal action against you.

Defaulting on your student loans can also have a negative impact on your credit score. A low credit score can make it difficult to get a loan, a mortgage, or even a job.

Defaulting on your student loans can also result in wage garnishment. This means that your lender can take money out of your paycheck to pay off your loans.

Finally, defaulting on your student loans can lead to tax penalties. This means that you may have to pay taxes on the money that your lender took from your paycheck.

All of these consequences can be extremely costly and difficult to deal with. It’s important to do everything you can to avoid defaulting on your student loans.
