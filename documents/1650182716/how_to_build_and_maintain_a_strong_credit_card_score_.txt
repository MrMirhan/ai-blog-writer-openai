How to build and maintain a strong credit card score 

A credit score is a number that is used to represent the creditworthiness of a person or entity. The score is derived from a person's credit history, which is a record of how a person has repaid past debts. A credit score is used by lenders to help them decide whether to extend credit to a person and at what interest rate.




A credit score is a three-digit number that lenders use to help them determine how risky it would be to lend money to you. The higher your credit score, the less risky it is for a lender to loan you money, and the lower your interest rate will be.

If you’re not sure where your credit score stands, you can get a free credit report from AnnualCreditReport.com. This report will tell you your credit score, as well as all of the accounts that are currently listed on your credit report.
