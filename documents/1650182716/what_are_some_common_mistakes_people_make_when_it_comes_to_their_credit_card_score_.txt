What are some common mistakes people make when it comes to their credit card score? 

Your credit score is a three-digit number that lenders use to help them decide how risky it is to lend you money. The higher your score, the less risky you are to lenders, and the more likely you are to get approved for a loan and to get a lower interest rate.

Your credit score is based on information in your credit report. Lenders look at your credit report to see how you've handled your debts in the past. They want to know if you've been late on payments, if you've maxed out your credit cards, and if you've defaulted on any loans.

Your credit score is also affected by how much credit you have available compared to how much you're using. If you have a lot of available credit, it shows that you're a responsible borrower who can handle lots of debt. If you're using a lot of your available credit, it shows that you may not be able to handle more debt.
