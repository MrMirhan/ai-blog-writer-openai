What is a credit score and how is it calculated? 

Your credit score is a calculation that reflects your creditworthiness. It is based on a number of factors, including your credit history, the amount of debt you owe, and your payment history.

Your credit history is a record of your credit activity, including the number of times you have applied for credit and the amount of credit you have outstanding. The more often you apply for credit, and the more debt you owe, the lower your credit score will be.

Your payment history is a record of how often you have paid your bills on time. The more often you pay your bills on time, the higher your credit score will be.

The amount of debt you owe is also a factor in your credit score. The more debt you have, the lower your credit score will be.

Other factors that can influence your credit score include the age of your credit history, the type of credit you have, and the number of credit accounts you have.




There are a few things you can do to improve your credit score. The most important is to make sure you always pay your bills on time. You should also try to keep your credit utilization low, and make sure your credit history is in good shape. You can also get a copy of your credit report and check for errors. If you find any, you can dispute them with the credit bureau.
