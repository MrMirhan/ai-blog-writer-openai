Your credit score is a three-digit number that is based on your credit history. It is used by lenders to determine how risky it is to lend you money. The higher your credit score, the less risky it is for a lender to lend you money and the lower your interest rate will be.

Your credit score is determined by five factors:

1. Payment history - 35%
